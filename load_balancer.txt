What a Load Balancer actually is

A Load Balancer sits in front of multiple servers and spreads incoming requests across them.

Instead of:

User → Server A (dead)


You get:

User → Load Balancer → Server A / B / C


Same app. Less screaming.

Where it fits in system design
Client
 → CDN (optional)
 → Load Balancer
 → App Servers (multiple)
 → DB / Cache


If traffic grows, the load balancer becomes non-negotiable.

What problems it solves (the real ones)
1. Traffic distribution

Without a load balancer:

One server handles everything

CPU spikes

Requests timeout

App “randomly” dies

With a load balancer:

Requests are spread evenly

Servers stay alive longer

Performance stays predictable

2. High availability

If one server crashes:

Load balancer stops sending traffic to it

Users are routed to healthy servers

Users never notice.
You quietly fix things. That’s the dream.

3. Scaling without pain

Need more power?

Add another server

Register it with the load balancer

Done

No DNS change. No client update. No panic.

How load balancing actually works
Common strategies

Round Robin: A → B → C → repeat

Least Connections: send traffic to the least busy server

IP Hash: same user → same server

Most apps start with round robin and live happily.

Health checks (the underrated feature)

Load balancers constantly ask servers:

“Are you alive?”


If a server fails:

It’s removed automatically

Traffic rerouted

This alone prevents a shocking number of outages.

Popular load balancers

NGINX
HAProxy
AWS Elastic Load Balancer

NGINX: flexible, widely used

HAProxy: fast, battle-tested

AWS ELB: managed, boring, reliable

Boring is good here.

Load Balancer vs CDN vs API Gateway (clear it up)
Thing	Job
CDN	Serve cached static content
Load Balancer	Distribute traffic to servers
API Gateway	Auth, rate limit, routing

Different tools. Different headaches.

Real example (Boss / Employee system)

You have:

3 backend servers

Same code on all

Flow:

api.mycompany.com
 → Load Balancer
   → Auth Server
   → User Server
   → Report Server


Boss logs in.
Employee logs in.
Traffic spreads evenly.
Nobody melts.

When you actually need a load balancer

More than one backend server

High availability matters

Traffic spikes exist

Production system with users you care about

If you’re serious about uptime, you use one.

What a load balancer does NOT do

It does not cache data

It does not fix slow code

It does not replace good architecture

It just gives your system breathing room.

Final mental model (remember this)

A load balancer makes multiple servers look like one stable server to the outside world.

That illusion is priceless.
