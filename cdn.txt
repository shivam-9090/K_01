A CDN is a global network of servers that stores copies of your static files close to users.

Static files = things that don’t change per user:

Images

CSS

JS

Fonts

Videos

PDFs

Where CDN fits in system design
User
 → CDN (nearest edge server)
 → Backend (only if needed)


Most requests should die at the CDN, not reach your backend.

How CDN works (step by step)

User requests myapp.com/style.css

CDN checks nearest edge server

If file exists (cache hit):

Served immediately

If not (cache miss):

CDN fetches from origin server

Stores it

Serves user

Next user nearby gets it instantly.

Why CDN makes your life easier
1. Faster load times

Shorter physical distance

Lower latency

Speed directly affects:

User experience

SEO

Conversion

2. Backend protection

Without CDN:

Every image hits backend

CPU wasted

Bandwidth wasted

With CDN:

Backend handles only dynamic logic

Static traffic never reaches it

3. Cost reduction

CDN bandwidth is cheaper

Backend servers stay smaller

Performance + savings. Rare combo.

4. DDoS & security bonus

Most CDNs provide:

DDoS mitigation

Rate limiting

TLS termination

Your backend sees fewer attackers.

CDN vs Cache vs Load Balancer (people confuse these)
Thing	Purpose
CDN	Cache static content globally
Redis	Cache dynamic data
Load Balancer	Distribute traffic to servers

Different tools. Different problems.

Real example (your web project)

You deploy:

Frontend on Netlify

Backend API on server

DNS:

myapp.com → CDN
api.myapp.com → Backend


Flow:

Images, JS → CDN

API calls → backend

Backend breathes. Users smile.

What CDN does NOT do

It does not run your business logic

It does not replace backend

It does not secure bad APIs automatically

Still need proper auth.

When CDN is absolutely necessary

Public website

Media-heavy app

Global users

Production system

If you skip CDN, you are choosing slowness.

Popular CDN providers

Cloudflare
Amazon CloudFront
Fastly

Cloudflare is usually the “turn it on and relax” option.

Final mental picture

Think of CDN as:

“Let the internet serve files so my server doesn’t have to.”
