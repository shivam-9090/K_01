== prompt

hey i have this , so do like add now as two method i need first login with github and acess there ..
2. Lock the OAuth scope (keep it minimal)

Use only:

read:user


That’s enough to:

Identify the user

Get GitHub ID

Get username + avatar

Do not add repo scopes here. That’s not OAuth’s job.

3. Decide how this fits your app auth

You must choose one (mentally, not in GitHub):

GitHub OAuth = login method
OR

GitHub OAuth = account linking

Both are valid. Just be consistent.

4. Decide what you will store after OAuth

Write this down now so you don’t improvise later.

Store:

github_user_id

github_username

avatar_url

linked_user_id (your app user)

Do not store:

OAuth access token long-term

Refresh token unless needed

Identity > access.

=== also i need to one feature afetr lohgin in profile add one thign connect to githbu and user can connect githbu accoutn and ...!!! after that github can acess repo ... 

- first do this all
