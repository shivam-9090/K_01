1️⃣ Server Health (Basic Infrastructure)

You need to track:

CPU usage

RAM usage

Disk space

Network traffic

Uptime

If CPU stays at 95 percent, your app is begging for help.

Tools

Grafana

Prometheus

Datadog

4

Prometheus collects metrics. Grafana shows pretty dashboards. Datadog does both and charges you emotionally.

2️⃣ Application Metrics (Very Important)

Not just server. Your app.

Track:

API response time

Request count

Error rate

Failed logins

Database query time

Example metrics:

/login response time > 2 seconds → problem

Error rate > 5 percent → something broke

DB query > 500 ms → index issue

Without this, you’re blind.

3️⃣ Logging (Structured Logs)

Logs should include:

Timestamp

Request ID

User ID (if available)

Error stack

Endpoint

Tools:

Winston

Pino

Elastic Stack (ELK)

4

Console.log in production is like writing system health updates on sticky notes.

4️⃣ Error Tracking (Critical)

You need automatic alerts when something crashes.

Use:

Sentry

Bugsnag

4

If users discover bugs before you do, that’s embarrassing.

5️⃣ Database Monitoring

Track:

Slow queries

Connection pool usage

Deadlocks

Index performance

If DB is slow, your entire management system becomes a slideshow.

6️⃣ Security Monitoring

For management systems especially:

Brute force login attempts

Suspicious IPs

Rate limit triggers

Failed authentication spikes

If someone tries 500 login attempts per minute, your logs should scream.

🧠 Production Monitoring Stack (Practical Setup)

For a serious but realistic setup:

Backend:

Pino or Winston for logging

Prometheus metrics endpoint

Sentry for errors

Infra:

Prometheus + Grafana
OR

Datadog (simpler but paid)

Security:

Rate limiting

Basic intrusion alerts

⚠ Brutal Truth

If you deploy without monitoring:

You don’t have a production system.
You have a hope-based system.

And hope is not an engineering strategy.

You’re building management tools. That means business data, maybe money, maybe employee info. That demands visibility.

Monitoring is not fancy. It’s responsibility.
